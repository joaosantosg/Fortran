# Fortran Personal Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal Fortran learning repository! Here, I document my progress and store exercises, examples, and projects as I learn Fortran programming language.

## About

Fortran is a powerful programming language often used in scientific and engineering applications. Through this repository, I aim to understand Fortran's syntax, features, and best practices better.

## Structure

- **/exercises**: Contains exercises covering different aspects of Fortran.
- **/examples**: Holds Fortran code examples illustrating specific techniques.
- **/projects**: Stores larger projects developed using Fortran.
- **/basics**: SStores basics programs used for the initial learning.
## How to Use
